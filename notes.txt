cccccrrrrrrrrbbb

Start mem - 16
Bytes - 3
Read or write - 1
Data to write (max 8 bytes) - 64
Return value - ?

Pop top mem location in queue
If (bbb + Bytes) overflows, then (we need to access multiple cells)
	Bytes2 = 1000 - bbb
	Read or write Bytes2 bytes to start mem
	Bytes2 = Bytes - Bytes2
	Read or write Bytes2 bytes to ccccc(rrrrrrrr + 1)000
else
	Simple write


Simple, single-process computer.
Virtual memory template can be loaded. Templates are something like this: [add][divider][add][divider][callback]
Call stack, something like this:
	[Exit][OS][Process][Caller]^[Func]
	Each command, [Func] is incremented:
	[Exit][OS][Process][Caller]^[Func + 1]
	
	If Func reaches end of loaded memory:
		Load next 8 bytes after Func
	If return is called:
		Control is returned to caller:
		[Exit][OS][Process]^[Caller][Func] ([Func will never be accessed again, probably overwritten soon.])


Each block is 8x16 bits. Blocks are arranged into cores 8x16. The memory is split into 4 cores, for parallel access.
